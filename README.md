JA3/JA4 Fingerprint Detection and Blocking with Nginx and ASP.NET Core
This demo showcases how to detect JA4 fingerprints using Nginx and block unwanted requests in an ASP.NET Core application.

Key Features:
Nginx Integration: JA3/JA4 fingerprints are captured at the Nginx layer using custom modules or scripts.
ASP.NET Core Blocking: Identified fingerprints are analyzed, and unwanted requests are blocked by the ASP.NET Core backend.
How It Works:
Fingerprint Detection: Nginx logs incoming requests' JA4 fingerprints.
Fingerprint Filtering: The ASP.NET Core application evaluates fingerprints against a denylist.
Response Handling: If a request matches a denied fingerprint, it is blocked with an appropriate response.
